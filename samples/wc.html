<center>Word Count.c
<p>Hweb Documentation</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>An example for Hweb. This example, based on a program by Klaus Guntermann
and Joachim Schrod [<i>TUGboat <b>7</b></i> (1986), 135-137] presents the
``word count'' program from /, rewritten in \.CWEB to demonstrate literate
programming in /. The level of detail in this document is intentionally
high, for didactic purposes; many of the things spelled out here don't
need to be explained in other programs.
<p>The purpose of \.wc is to count lines, words, and/or characters in a
list of files. The number of lines in a file is the number of newline characters
it contains. The number of characters is the file length in bytes. A ``word''
is a maximal sequence of consecutive characters other than newline, space,
or tab, containing at least one visible ASCII code. (We assume that the
standard ASCII code is in use.)
<p>This version of \.wc has a nonstandard ``silent'' option (\.-s), which
suppresses printing except for the grand totals over all files.
<p>Many programs share a common structure. It's probably a good idea to
state the overall structure explicitly at the outset, even though the various
parts could all be introduced in unnamed sections of the code if we wanted
to add them piecemeal.
<p>Here, then, is an overview of the file \.wc.c that is defined by this
Hweb program.
<p>&lt;Header files to include>
<br>&lt;Global variables>
<br>&lt;Functions>
<br>&lt;The main program>
<p>&nbsp;We must include the standard I/O definitions, since we want to
send formatted output to |stdout| and |stderr|.
<p>&nbsp;<a href="wc.c">includes</a>
<p>&nbsp;The |status| variable will tell the operating system if the run
was successful or not, and |prog_name| is used in case there's an error
message to be printed.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;Now we come to the general layout of the |main| function.
<p>&lt;Variables local to |main|>
<br>&lt;Set up option selection>
<br>&lt;Process all the files>
<br>&lt;Print the grand totals if there were multiple files>;
<br>exit(status);
<p><a href="wc.c#main">main</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See code
<p>&nbsp;If the first argument begins with a `\.-', the user is choosing
the desired counts and specifying the order in which they should be displayed.
Each selection is given by the initial character (lines, words, or characters).
For example, `\.-cl' would cause just the number of characters and the
number of lines to be printed, in that order. The default, if no special
argument is given, is `\.-lwc'.
<p>We do not process this string now; we simply remember where it is. It
will be used to control the formatting at output time.
<p>If the `\.-' is immediately followed by `\.s', only summary totals are
printed.
<p>@&lt;Var...@>= int file_count; /* how many files there are */ char *which;
/* which counts to print */ int silent=0; /* nonzero if the silent option
was selected */
<p>&nbsp;/* if no option is given, print all three values */
<p>&nbsp;Now we scan the remaining arguments and try to open a file, if
possible. The file is processed and its statistics are given. We use a
|do| ... |while| loop because we should read from the standard input if
no file name is given.
<p>&lt;Process...@>= argc-; do@+ @&lt;If a file is given, try to open |*(++argv)|;
|continue| if unsuccessful@>; @&lt;Initialize pointers and counters@>;
@&lt;Scan file@>; @&lt;Write statistics for file@>; @&lt;Close file@>;
@&lt;Update grand totals@>; /* even if there is only one file */
<p>Here's the code to open the file. A special trick allows us to handle
input from |stdin| when no name is given. Recall that the file descriptor
to |stdin| is 0; that's what we use as the default initial value.
<p>/* file descriptor, initialized to |stdin| */
<p>/* read access code for system |open| routine */
<p>&lt;If a file...@>= if (file_count>0 (fd=open(*(++argv),READ_ONLY))&lt;0)
fprintf (stderr, "@.cannot open file@> status|=cannot_open_file; file_count-;
continue;
<p>&lt;Close file@>= close(fd);
<p>&nbsp;We will do some homemade buffering in order to speed things up:
Characters will be read into the |buffer| array before we process them.
To do this we set up appropriate pointers and counters.
<p>d buf_size BUFSIZ /* \.stdio.h's |BUFSIZ| is chosen for efficiency*/
<p>&lt;Var...@>= char buffer[buf_size]; /* we read the input into this
array */ register char *ptr; /* the first unprocessed character in |buffer|
*/ register char *buf_end; /* the first unused position in |buffer| */
register int c; /* current character, or number of characters just read
*/ int in_word; /* are we within a word? */ long word_count, line_count,
char_count; /* number of words, lines, and characters found in the file
so far */
<p>The grand totals must be initialized to zero at the beginning of the
program. If we made these variables local to |main|, we would have to do
this initialization explicitly; however, /'s globals are automatically
zeroed. (Or rather, ``statically zeroed.'') (Get it?) @^Joke@>
<p>&nbsp;/* total number of words, lines, and chars */
<p>&nbsp;The present section, which does the counting that is \.wc's <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</i>, was actually one of the simplest to write. We look at
each character and change state if it begins or ends a word.
<p>&nbsp;Buffered I/O allows us to count the number of characters almost
for free.
<p>&nbsp;It's convenient to output the statistics by defining a new function
|wc_print|; then the same function can be used for the totals. Additionally
we must decide here if we know the name of the file we have processed or
if it was just |stdin|.
<p>&lt;Write...@>
<p>We might as well improve a bit on /'s \.wc by displaying the number
of files too.
<p>Here now is the function that prints the values according to the specified
options. The calling routine is supposed to supply a newline. If an invalid
option character is found we inform the user about proper usage of the
command. Counts are printed in 8-digit fields so that they will line up
in columns.
<p>&nbsp;Incidentally, a test of this program against the system \.wc command
on a SPARC station showed that the ``official'' \.wc was slightly slower.
Furthermore, although that \.wc gave an appropriate error message for the
options `\.-abc', it made no complaints about the options `\.-labc'! Dare
we suggest that the system routine might have been better if its programmer
had used a more literate approach?
