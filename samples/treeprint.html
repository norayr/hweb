<p><br>
<p>Directory Trees. Our object is to print out a directory hierarchy in
some pleasant way. The program takes output from <tt>find * -type d -print
\.| sort</tt> <i>system dependencies </i>and produces a nicer-looking listing.
More precisely, our input, which is the output of <tt>find</tt> followed
by <tt>sort</tt>, is a list of fully qualified directory names (parent
and child separated by slashes |'/'|); everything has already been sorted
nicely into lexicographic order.
<p>The <tt>treeprint</tt> routine takes one option, |"-p, which tells it
to use the printer's line-drawing set, rather than the terminal's.

<p>&nbsp;We make all the siblings of a directory a linked list off of its
left child, and the offspring a linked list off the right side. Data are
just directory names. @d sibling left @d child right

<br>&lt;|main| variable...>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Input. Reading the tree is simple-we read one line at a time, and call
on the recursive |add_tree| procedure.
<p>&lt;If |buf| contains a newline, make it end there>;
<br>add_tree(rootptr, buf);
<p>&lt;Global include...>=
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;Depending what system you're on, you may or may not get a newline
in |buf|.
<br>&lt;If |buf| contains a newline...>= p=buf;
<p>&nbsp;To add a string, we split off the first part of the name and insert
it into the sibling list. We then do the rest of the string as a child
of the new node.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&lt;Break up the string so |p| is the first word, |s| points at null-begun
remainder, and |slashed| tells whether |*s=='/'| on entry>;
<p>&lt;Allocate new node to hold string of size |strlen(p)|>;
<p>&nbsp;We perform some nonsense to cut off the string |p| so that |p|
just holds the first word of a multiword name. Variable |s| points at what
was either the end of |p| or a slash delimiting names. In either case |*s|
is made |'\0'|. Later, depending on whether we want to pass the whole string
or the last piece, we will restore the slash or advance |s| one character
to the right.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;Node allocation is perfectly standard ... @&lt;Allocate new node...@>=
*rootptr=(struct tnode *) malloc (sizeof(struct tnode)); (*rootptr)->left
= (*rootptr)->right = NULL; (*rootptr)->data = malloc (strlen(p)+1);
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;In this simple implementation, we just read from standard input.
@&lt;Read...@>= read_tree(stdin, root);
<p>Output. We begin by defining some lines, tees, and corners. The |s|
stands for screen and the |p| for printer. You will have to change this
for your line-drawing set. @^system dependencies@>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;The default is to use the terminal's line drawing set. @&lt;Global
declarations@>= char vert=svert; char horiz=shoriz; char cross=scross;
char corner=scorner;
<p>&nbsp;With option |"-p use the printer character set. @&lt;Search for
options...@>= while (-argc>0) if (**++argv=='-') switch (*++(*argv)) case
'p': vert=pvert; horiz=phoriz; cross=pcross; corner=pcorner; break; default:
fprintf(stderr,"treeprint: bad option - break;
<p>&nbsp;We play games with a character stack to figure out when to put
in vertical bars. A vertical bar connects every sibling with its successor,
but the last sibling in a list is followed by blanks, not by vertical bars.
The state of bar-ness or space-ness for each preceding sibling is recorded
in the |indent_string| variable, one character (bar or blank) per sibling.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;Children get printed before siblings. We don't bother trying to
bring children up to the same line as their parents, because the / filenames
are so long.
<p>We define a predicate telling us when a sibling is the last in a series.
d is_last(S) (S->sibling==NULL)
<br><a href="treeprint.c#print_node">print_node</a> See Code for print_node(fp,
indent_string, node)
<br><a href="treeprint.c#main"></a>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;/* Add vertical bar or space for this sibling&nbsp; ;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;For simplicity, we originally wrote connecting lines with |'|'|,
|'+'|, and |'-'|. Now we replace those characters with appropriate characters
from the line-drawing set. We take the early vertical bars and replace
them with characters from |indent_string|, and we replace the other characters
appropriately. We are sure to put a |corner|, not a |cross|, on the last
sibling in a group. @&lt;Replace chars...@>= is=indent_string; for (p=string;
*p!='\0'; p++) switch(*p) case '|': *p=*is++; break; case '+': *p=(is_last(node)
? corner : cross); break; case '-': *p=horiz; break; default: break;
<p>&nbsp;For this simple implementation, we just write on standard output.
<p>&lt;Write...@>= print_node(stdout, indent_string, root);
