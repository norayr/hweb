<p>The Problem. Our task is to help a convict escape from prison. The prison
is 4 cells square and the convict (represented by `C' in the diagram, below)
is in the northwesternmost cell. He can move horizontally or vertically
(not diagonally) from cell to cell. The only exit is in the southeasternmost
cell.

Complicating the problem are the 14 policemen (represented by `P's in the
diagram) blocking the convict's way. The convict must kill all the policemen
before he can leave, but cannot return to any cell he has already been
in (that would be too easy).
<p>The Solution. The program that solves the problem will be laid out like
most C programs: &lt;Header files used by the program>
<br>&lt;Global variables>
<br>&lt;Functions>
<br>&lt;The main program>;
<p>&nbsp;We will need to represent the prison-a 2-dimensional array seems
the logical choice. As the convict ``visits'' each cell, we will put a
number denoting the order in which the cell was visited into the appropriate
array element (we will use zero to represent a cell that has not yet been
visited). Thus we can use the zero-ness of a cell to determine whether
or not it has been visited.
<p>We can also use this property to avoid making special cases out of the
outer cells (which have fewer than 4 exits to other cells). We create an
array 2 elements wider than the prison and initialize all the array elements
that do not correspond to actual cells to -1 (marking them as ``already
visited''-a convenient fiction). All cells in the prison now have 4 neighbors
and can be treated exactly alike.
<p>@dhas_been_visited(m,n)
<br>&nbsp;<a href="puzzle.c">matrix</a>
<br>(prison[m][n]!=0) @
<br>&lt;Global...@>
<p>@ The main program is simple. We let the |solve| function do all the
work. If |solve| succeeds for the initial cell (1,1), we print the configuration
of the prison (showing the order in which the cells were visited); if not,
we print an error message. The latter case should never happen-it will
occur only if there is a bug in the program or if we have misunderstood
the problem.
<p>@&lt;The main...@>= void main(void)
<p>if (solve(1,1))@/print_prison(); else@/fprintf(stderr, &Iuml;mpossible");
<p>@ In order to produce the necessary output we need to include the ``Standard
I/O'' library: @&lt;Header...@>= #include &lt;stdio.h>
<p>@ Printing the prison configuration is trivial, so we might as well
get it out of the way. @&lt;Functions...@>= void print_prison(void)
<p>register int i,j; for (i=1; i&lt;=4;i++) for (j=1; j&lt;=4;j++) @/printf("
putc('',stdout);
<p>@ The |solve| function is fairly straightforward, but it has a few special
cases to deal with. The parameters represent the row and column numbers
of the next cell to visit. If the cell has already been visited, it can't
be visited again, so the current attempt at a solution fails. The solution
can also fail prematurely if the convict attempts to visit the exit cell
(4,4) without having visited all the other cells (and killing the policemen
therein).
<p>If the cell has not been visited before, we mark it as having been visited
and recursively check each of the 4 neighboring cells to see if a solution
exists starting from that cell (remember, all cells previously visited
have been marked and cannot be visited again). If a solution exists, we
report success. Otherwise, we report failure and pretend that the convict
hasn't actually visited this cell yet. @d succeed return 1 @d fail return
0 @f succeed return @f fail return
<p>@&lt;Functions...@>= int solve(register int m, register int n)
<p>if(has_been_visited(m,n))@/fail; @&lt;If this is the exit cell, |succeed|
if we have visited all the other cells, |fail| otherwise@>; prison[m][n]=++number_of_cells_visited;
/* mark cell as ``visited'' */ if(solve(m+1,n)||solve(m,n+1)||solve(m-1,n)||solve(m,n-1))@/
succeed; @&lt;Pretend that the convict hasn't actually visited this cell
yet@>; fail;
<p>@ @&lt;If...@>= if (m==4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
n==4) if (number_of_cells_visited==15) /* all other cells have been visited
*/ @/succeed; else@/ fail;
<p>@ @&lt;Pretend...@>= -number_of_cells_visited;prison[m][n]=0;
<p>@ We start out with no cells having been visited. @&lt;Global...@>=int
number_of_cells_visited=0; @*Epilogue. When we ran the program, it produced
the `Impossible' message. After checking out the program extensively, we
found no bugs-we did not completely understand the problem. It turns out
that the convict, while not allowed to return to a cell in which he has
killed a policeman, <i>is </i>allowed to return to his original cell. The
following is a valid solution:
