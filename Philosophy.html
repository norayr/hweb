The following "philosophical warm-up" is taken from a recent

as he is often called on the net,
wrote the original WEB (for the Pascal language), TeX
and Metafont (both written in WEB), and is still actively

<H2>Why I Must Write Readable Programs</H2>
"Computer programs are fun to write, and well-written computer
programs are fun to read. One of life's greatest pleasures can 
be the composition of a computer program that you know will be a
pleasure for other people to read, and for yourself to read.  <P>
Computer programs can also do useful work. One of life's
greatest sources of satisfaction is the knowledge that something
you have created is contributing to the progress of welfare of
society.  <P>
Some people even get paid for writing computer programs! Programming
can therefore be triply rewarding---on aesthetic, humanitarian, and
economic grounds.  <P>
Of course I don't mean to imply that programming is easy. Easy things
are often amusing and relaxing, but their value soon fades. Greater
pleasure, deeper satisfaction, and higher wages are associated with
genuine accomplishments, with the successful fulfillment of a
challenging task.  <P>
I have spent a good deal of my life trying to help make computer
programming as rewarding as possible, in all three senses. t first,
I thought programming was primarily analogous to
musical composition---to the creation of intricate patterns, which are
meant to be performed. But lately I have come to realize that a far
better analogy is available: Programming is best regarded as the process
of creating works of literature, which are meant to be read.  <P>
Literature of the program genre is performable by machines, but that
is not its main purpose. The computer programs that are truly beautiful,
useful, and profitable must be readable by people. So we ought to address
them to people, not to machines. All of the major problems associated
with computer programming---issues of reliability, portability, learnability,
maintainability, and efficiency---are ameliorated when programs and their
dialogs with users become more literate.  <P>
...  <P>
Literate programming is still a fairly new concept, still in its
infancy, still undergoing much-needed experimentation. Many people
have contributed important ideas and independent approaches to the
creation of systems that improve on WEB
in various ways. In
<A NAME=7 HREF="DEKbook.html">this</A>
book I describe the techniques that have worked best for me, but I have
never imagined that any of my ideas would be the "last word" in any sense.
I am sure that people with differing tastes will prefer a system that
differs from my own initial attempts.  <P>
The time is on ripe for second-generation systems that integrate
literate programming into complete programming environments. "  <P>
