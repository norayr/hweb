<p><b><font size=+1>Introduction</font></b></center>

<p><font size=+1>The philosophy behind Hweb is that programmers who want
to provide the best possible documentation for their programs need two
things simultaneously: a text processing and formatting system, and a progamming
language system. Neither type of system can provide the best documentation
by itself. But when both are appropriately combined, we obtain a system
that is much more useful than either system separately.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The structure of a software program may be thought of
as a ``web'' that is made up of many interconnected pieces. To document
such a program, we want to explain each individual part of the web and
how it relates to its neighbors. The hypertext tools provided by hweb give
us an opportunity to explain the local structure of each part by making
that structure visible, and the programming tools provided by C make it
possible for us to specify the algorithms formally and unambiguously. By
combining the two, we can develop a style of programming that maximizes
our ability to perceive the structure of a complex piece of software, and
at the same time the documented programs can be mechanically translated
into a working software system that matches the documentation.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The&nbsp; Hweb system consists of two parts; programs
for working with text and html, and guidelines and methods for laying down
programs. When writing a Hweb program the user keeps the code and the documentation
in two files, labeled with the same name except for the extension . The
something.html file is an output file and display file,&nbsp; which can
correctly display typographic details like page layout and the use of indentation,
italics, boldface, and mathematical symbols. You also have a modified C
source code program that can be compiled and run as is, or you can run
the command htangle -isomething.c&nbsp; to get a&nbsp; source file free
of any html.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Besides providing a documentation tool, Hweb enhances
the C language by providing the ability to hide information and rearrange
pieces of the program text, so that a large system can be understood entirely
in terms of small sections and their local interrelationships.</font>
<br><font size=+1>The advantage of programming in Hweb is that the algorithms
can be expressed in ``untangled'' form, with each section explained separately.</font>
<p><font size=+1>A user of Hweb should be fairly familiar with the C programming
language. A minimal amount of acquaintance with html is also desirable,
but in fact it can be acquired as one uses Hweb, since WSYWG editors are
available which require virtually no knowledge of that language. To someone
familiar with both C and html the amount of effort necessary to learn the
commands of Hweb is small.</font>

<p><b><font size=+1>Overview</font></b></center>

<p><font size=+1>Three kinds of material go into hWeb files: raw text,
html markup&nbsp; and C program text. A programmer writing in Hweb should
be thinking both of the documentation and of the C program being created;
i.e., the programmer should be instinctively aware of the different uses
that C program and documentation will be put to. The program should end
up being readable as a document, and give pleasure and information for
years to come</font>
<p><font size=+1>A Hweb file is built up from units called <i>sections
</i>that
are more or less self-contained. Each section has three parts:</font>
<p><font size=+1>A test part, containing explanatory material about what
is going on in the section.</font>
<dl compact><font size=+1>A markup part, containing links to the program.</font></dl>

<dl compact><font size=+1>A code, containing program code that C can understand</font>
<br><font size=+1>This C code should ideally be about a dozen lines long,
so that it is easily comprehensible as a unit and so that its structure
is readily perceived.</font></dl>
<font size=+1>The three parts of each section must appear in this order;
i.e., the / commentary must come first, then the middle part, and finally
the / code. Any of the parts may be empty.</font>
<br><font size=+1></font>&nbsp;<font size=+1></font>

<p><b><font size=+1>Implementation</font></b></center>
<b><font size=+1></font></b>
<p><font size=+1>The C source code is edited with a simpl text editor.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>The html documentation file is edited with a html editor
or a text editor.</font>
<br><font size=+1>The doc file should describe how the propram works, the
algorithem and design concepts.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>the C source file has html markup embedded in it:</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>The first line in the file has /* C comment marker, then</font>
<br><font size=+1>&lt;html></font>
<br><font size=+1>&lt;body></font>
<br><font size=+1>*/</font>
<br><font size=+1>are used at the beginning of the source file to qualify
the file as readable by a html browser</font>
<br><font size=+1>Then &lt;pre> markup is used to tell the browser to not
reformat the following text.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>Following is normal C program text, until a link point
is needed.</font>
<br><font size=+1>For example, you may wish to mark the location of the
main() function.</font>
<br><font size=+1>The a comment /* marker is used, followed by</font>
<br><font size=+1>&lt;/pre></font>
<br><font size=+1>&lt;a name="main">main&lt;/a></font>
<br><font size=+1>&lt;pre></font>
<br><font size=+1>*/</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>In the html doc file the following contruct is used to
link to it:</font>
<br><font size=+1>&lt;a href="filename.c#main">main&lt;/a></font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>The same method can be used with .h header files.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>The C source file ends with</font>
<br><font size=+1>/*</font>
<br><font size=+1>&lt;/pre></font>
<br><font size=+1>&lt;/body></font>
<br><font size=+1>&lt;/html></font>
<br><font size=+1>*/</font>
<p><font size=+1>The C source can be run through the&nbsp; compiler as
is. The html markup tags will not be seen by the compiler and the program
should compile as intended.</font><font size=+1></font>
<p><font size=+1>However, a utility is provided to remove all html tags
from the C source, if desired. Run the utility htangle if you need to have
C source code with no html tags.</font>

<td>This document describes a version a system of program writing that
gets&nbsp; its inspiration&nbsp; from
<br>Don Knuth's WEB system, and as adapted by Silvio Levy for CWEB. Since
its creation in 1987, CWEB has been revised and enhanced in various ways,
by both Knuth and Levy.
<p>Ramsey has made literate programming accessible to users of yet other
languages by means of his SPIDER system [see <i>Communications of the ACM
<b>32</b></i> (1989), 1051-1055].&nbsp;
