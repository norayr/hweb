<P>This document would not have happened without the help of many people.
Among them are Marcus Speh, George Greenwade, Rob Beezer, Joachim
Schrod, Piet van Oostrum, Ross N. Williams, Nelson H. F. Beebe, and
Andrew Johnson.  A special thanks to Aliza R. Panitz for the text
describing how to execute an anonymous ftp for files of interest.</P>
<P>Any omissions from these acknowledgements should be considered an act of
stupidity on my part.  Of course, the authors of literate programming
tools mentioned above all play a vital role in the vitality of literate
programming. Furthermore, participants in the comp.programming.literate
newsgroup (and associated mailing list) all contributed in various
fashions.  Thank all of you.</P>
