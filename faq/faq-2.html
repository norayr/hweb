<P>This document is for new and experienced users of literate programming
tools.  The purpose is to explain the concept of literate programming and
to provide a resource for locating files of interest to literate
programmers and those interested in literate programming.</P>

<P>Comments and constructive criticisms are welcome.  Direct flames to
<CODE>/dev/null</CODE> (or <CODE>nul</CODE> if you're a msdos user! <CODE>;-)</CODE> If
you find an error, please report it.  I'm particularly interested in
establishing the locations of generally available literate programming
tools.  If you are the author of such a tool and wish to have it
included in this list, please send email.</P>
