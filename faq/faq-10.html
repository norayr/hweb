<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 World Wide Web</A></H2>

<P>An untapped resource (by me anyway ;-) is the World Wide Web.  Marcus
Speh has expended considerable effort in this regard.  If you're
connected to WWW, then access:
<PRE>
  http://info.desy.de:80/user/projects/LitProg.html
</PRE>

If you aren't connected to WWW, telnet to info.cern.ch and explore.
You can reach Marcus' literate programming pages by typing:
<PRE>
  go http://info.desy.de:80/user/projects/LitProg.html
</PRE>

or use a WWW browser and access the URL
<PRE>
  ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news-answers/www/resources/literate-programming
</PRE>

Help for people who have only Email and neither WWW nor telnet, can be
obtained by Email from TEST-LIST@INFO.CERN.CH by sending a message,
<PRE>
  SEND &lt;http_address&gt;,
</PRE>

for example,
<PRE>
  SEND http://info.desy.de:80/user/projects/LitProg.html
</PRE>

to retrieve the LitProg library page.   A help file can be retrieved by
sending a message to the list server above with the text
<PRE>
  HELP
</PRE>

in the body of the message.  Instructions will be returned by email. For
literate programming documents, you can try anonymous ftp to
<CODE>rtfm.mit.edu</CODE> and retrieve the official Usenet resource file
<PRE>
  /pub/usenet/news.answers/www/resources/literate-programming
</PRE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 TeX Resources</A></H2>

<P>Another resource of interest to literate programmers is the
comp.text.tex newsgroup.   If you're using (La)TeX as your typsetting
system and have access to internet, then you should investigate this
resource.  </P>
<P>Another reason the TeX resources should be important is that so many of
the literate programming tools rely on either plain TeX or LaTeX as
their text formatter.  (La)TeX software systems exist for most computing
platforms.  These systems can be found on CTAN and other major archive
sites.  Use archie to find them or simply ftp to one of the CTAN
sites and browse.</P>
