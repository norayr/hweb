<P>This document will continue to evolve.  I'm planning on adding entries
for additional literate programming tools and will expand the sections
on examples as more examples become available. Tools I will include are
WEB (the original pascal version) for starters. Others will be added as
I find and document them.  Omission of a particular tool should not be
considered a snub in any sense--simply an error or oversight on my part.</P>
