<H2><A NAME="s13">13. How to anonymously ftp</A></H2>

<P>Pretty much everything mentioned here is available by
anonymous FTP.  FAQ lists cross-posted to news.answers and
rec.answers can be gotten from <CODE>rtfm.mit.edu</CODE>
<F>18.181.0.24</F>, under <CODE>/pub/usenet/news.answers</CODE> or
under <CODE>/pub/usenet/more.specific.group.name</CODE></P>
<P>"anonymous FTP" is just a way for files to be stored where anyone
can retrieve them over the Net.    For example, to retrieve the
latest version of the literate programming FAQ, do the following:
<PRE>
&gt; ftp rtfm.mit.edu              /* connect to the site; message follows */
&gt; anonymous                     /* type this when it asks for your name */
&gt; &lt;your email address&gt;          /* type your address as the password    */
&gt; cd /pub/usenet                /* go to the directory you want to be   */
&gt; cd comp.programming.literate  /* one level down (no slash).           */
&gt; dir                           /* look at what's there                 */
&gt; get literate-progamming-faq   /* get the file; case-sensitive         */
&gt; quit                          /* stop this mysterious thing           */
</PRE>

If your FTP program complains that it doesn't know where the site you
want to use is, type the numerical address instead of the sitename:
<PRE>
&gt; ftp 18.181.0.24               /* connect with numerical address */
</PRE>

If you don't have ftp access, send e-mail to <CODE>mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu</CODE>
with the single word "help" in the body of the message.</P>
<P>Getting binary files (executables, or any compressed files) is only
slightly more difficult.   You need to set binary mode inside FTP before
you transfer the file.
<PRE>
&gt; binary            /* set binary transfer mode  */
&gt; ascii             /* set back to text transfer mode */
</PRE>

FAQs and spoiler lists are generally ascii files; everything else is
generally binary files.</P>
<P>Some common extensions on binary files in archive sites are:
<PRE>
  .Z           Compressed; extract with uncompress
  .tar.Z       Compressed 'tape archive'; uncompress then untar or tar -xvf
  .gz or .z    Gnu gzip; use gunzip (available from prep.gnu.ai.mit.edu)
  .sit         (Mac) StufIt archive
  .zip         Extract with Zip or Unzip
  .zoo         Yet another archive/compress program
  .lhe         (Amiga) ?
  .lzh         Lha archive program.
  .arj         (PC) Arj archive program.
  .exe         (PC) Sometimes self-extracting archives-just execute them.
  .uue or .UUE Transfer as text file; use uudecode to convert to binary
  .hqx         (Mac) BinHex format; transfer in text mode
</PRE>

Generic help can be found in the FAQs of comp.binaries.
<CODE>&lt;your_system_type></CODE> for how to transfer, extract,
and virus-check binary files. (At <CODE>rtfm.mit.edu</CODE>)</P>
<P>If you can't FTP from your site, use one of the following ftp-by-mail
servers:
<PRE>
  ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
  ftpmail@src.doc.ic.ac.uk
  ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au
  ftpmail@grasp.insa-lyon.fr
</PRE>

For complete instructions, send a message reading "help" to the server.</P>
<P>If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, or exactly where it
is, there are programs and servers that can help you.  For more info,
send e-mail to <CODE>mail-server@rtfm.mit</CODE>.with with the body of the
message reading send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources</P>

verbatim from her post on faq-maintainers with only minor modifications.</P>
