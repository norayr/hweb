<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Is there a newsgroup?</A></H2>

<P>One of the most important resources is the literate programming
newsgroup, <CODE>comp.programming.literate</CODE>.  Because of the amount of
spamming and unrelated the posts, the newsgroup is now moderated.  Posts
to the newsgroup are now routed through litprog-mod@cs.virginia.edu.  If
your news reader does not post through this address, then you will be
unable to post messages to the newgroup.  You can read this newsgroup
using your standard reader.  </P>
