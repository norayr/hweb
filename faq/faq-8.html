<H2><A NAME="s8">8. What literate programming tools are available?</A></H2>

<P>A significant number of tools for literate programming are available.
Most have been ported from their original systems, so support multiple
computer platforms.  If you are the developer of such a tool, and would
like to make the software freely available, please send me email and
I'll reply with a form (like those below) for you to fill in.  (Or
short-circuit the process and kludge a form from below. :-)</P>

Description:

  CLiP does not use explicit commands to perform the extraction
  process. Rather it recognizes pseudostatements written as comments in
  the programming language in question. CLiP distinguishes
  pseudostatements from ordinary comments because the former comply with
  a particular style. This style can be adjusted to suit virtually any
  programming language. The CLiP approach to LP makes the system
  extremely versatile. It is independent of programming language and
  text processing environment. We designed CLiP to be compatible with
  hypertext systems as well. Some hypertext examples are at
      ftp://sun01.info.wau.nl/clip/html/queens.htm
      ftp://sun01.info.wau.nl/clip/html/pal1.htm
 
  Features:
  + CLiP imposes virtually no limitations on the text-processing system
    used to produce the documentation. If the text-processor supports
    these items you can
    + structure the documentation according to your own taste.
    + include drawings, pictures, tables etc.
    + disclose your documentation my means of X-ref tables, Indexes,
      Table of contents, Table of tables, Table of figures, etc.
    + typeset the documented code.
  + Extracts any number of modules from a maximum of 64 source files.
  + No pretty-printing. Code from the source files is copied &quot;as is&quot; to
    the module.
  + Appearance of code segments in the documentation matches those of
    the modules to ease the identification of code segments.
  + Supports partially specified data types.
  + Comprehensive user manual (preliminary version) and technical
    description.
  - No automatic generation of a X-ref table for program identifiers.

Readme:                         at same location
Description:

                                This is mCWEB 1.0, a descendant of the CWEB system of structured
                                documentation by Donald E. Knuth and Silvio Levy.  It adds some
                                features that are indispensable when working in a team. mCWEB
                                regards a project of a book consisting of several chapter files.
                                By means of import and export commands, it automatically manages
                                all relationships between the chapters of a book and to other
                                books.

                                Interface documentation is now also part of mCWEB. It is
                                extracted into a second TeX file. This makes it possible to
                                define well known interfaces between the individual parts of a
                                project that will be implemented by different persons.

                                In addition, mCWEB parses C header files to find out about all
                                the datatypes defined there.

                                mCWEB comes with a full completely rewritten user manual and is
                                compatible with CWEB.

  FunnelWeb 3.0AC also supports HTML, and creates appropriate
  hypertext links within the document among the code sections.
  FunnelWeb 3.0AC also supports automatic and manual insertion of line
  directives, so that compiler errors can be flagged back to the
  original FunnelWeb source file.  FunnelWeb 3.0AC is completely
  compatible with FunnelWeb v3.0 sources (with one minor exception;
  see the file README.ABC which comes with the FunnelWeb 3.0AC
  distribution).

Support:  Supported by A.B.Coates (coates@physics.uq.edu.au), subject
          to the time constraints imposed by his thesis.

Description:

  The Literate Programming Workshop is an environment for the integrated
  development of program source text and documentation in combined
  documents. It consists of a WYSIWYG word processor based on a style
  sheet approach, a mechanism to extract parts of the text in a
  document, and a project management system that handles multi-document
  projects. The system is designed to be used in conjunction with the
  Macintosh Programmer's Workshop: it prepares raw source text for the
  MPW compilers, accepts MPW error messages, and shows them in the
  context of the original documents. Automatic indexing and hypertext
  features allow for easy access to both source text and documentation.

  LPW is shareware.

                Simplified,'' IEEE Software, September 1994, pp97-105.

Description:

  noweb is designed to meet the needs of literate programmers while
  retaining the simplest possible input format.  Its primary
  advantages are simplicity, extensibility, and language-independence.
  noweb uses 5 control sequences to WEB's 27.  The noweb manual is
  only 3 pages; an additional page explains how to customize its LaTeX
  output.  noweb works ``out of the box'' with any programming
  language, and supports TeX, latex, and HTML back ends.  A back end
  to support full hypertext or indexing takes about 250 lines; a
  simpler one can be written in 40 lines of awk.  The primary
  sacrifice relative to WEB is that code is not prettyprinted.

  noweb supports indexing and identifier cross-reference, including
  hypertext ``hot links.'' noweb includes a simple, efficient
  LaTeX-to-HTML converter, so you can use hypertext browsers on your
  legacy documents.  noweb can also process nuweb programs, so you can
  use noweb to convert a standard nuweb program to HTML with one
  command.

Description:

  A single program that takes a web file written in a combination of
  latex and any programming language(s) and produces a latex file that
  can be pretty printed and a set of files containing code for
  compilation/interpretation by the appropriate language processors.

  Strengths include speed, simplicity, multiple languages, nice indices
  and cross-references, latex.  Doesn't require any special macros or
  macro files.

  Drawbacks: latex-dependent, no code pretty printing, harder to make
  indices than cweb.

  More good stuff: nice support for make, doesn't reformat source files,
  so they're easy to debug.  Lots of control without too much effort.
  That is, it doesn't do too much!

  Future directions... Very little change planned, except perhaps
  refinements in the indexing software.

Version:        2.1
Hardware:       Unix and DOS platforms
Languages:      Any dialect of Lisp.
Formatter:      LaTeX.
Availability:   The Unix version is in the Scheme Repository and it is
                available via anonymous ftp from:
                  cs.indiana.edu:/pub/scheme-repository/utl/schemeweb.sh

Readme:         In bundle with above.

Description:

  SchemeWEB is a Unix filter that allows you to generate both Lisp and
  LaTeX code from one source file.  The generated LaTeX code formats
  Lisp programs in typewriter font obeying the spacing in the source
  file. Comments can include arbitrary LaTeX commands.  SchemeWEB was
  originally developed for the Scheme dialect of Lisp, but it can easily
  be used with most other dialects.

Developer:      Lee Wittenberg &lt;leew@pilot.njin.net&gt;
Version:        Unknown
Hardware:       Needs Microsoft Word for Windows, v.2.x, and, of course,
                MS-Windows 3.x.
Languages:      Any programming language.

                maintenance.
Availability:   Anonymous ftp from:

                World-Wide Web (WWW)
Readme:         WORDWEB.DOC in the downloadable package describes the
                system.

Description:

  WinWordWEB is a set of a Word for Windows macros (plus a paragraph
  style) that provide a crude literate programming environment.  The
  ``look and feel'' of the system is based on Norman Ramsey's noweb, but
  can easily be modified to suit individual tastes.

Support:

  None.  WinWordWEB was written as a prototype to see if a WYSIWYG
  literate programming system was possible.  It is intended as a jumping
  off point for future work by others. However, the system is
  surprisingly usable as it stands, and the author is interested in
  hearing from users (satisfied and dissatisfied).

  Anyone interested in actively supporting (and improving) the product
  should contact the author via email.
