<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Are there other tools I should know about?</A></H2>

<P>First of all, I'll list some not-quite-literate-programming tools.
Some may consider these to be pretty-printers.  Others may call them
literate programming tools.  In any event, they don't seem to be quite
in the same category as the tools listed above, so I'll include them
here.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 C2LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
<PRE>
Developer:      John D. Ramsdell
Version:        Unknown
Hardware:       Unix
Languages:      C
Formatter:      LaTeX but it's easy to change the formatter.
Availability:   Anonymous ftp from
                  omnigate.clarkson.edu:/pub/tex/tex-programs/c2latex.
Readme:         Absent.  Documentation is in the C source for c2latex.

Description:

  C2latex provides simple support for literate programming in C.  Given
  a C source file in which the comments have been written in LaTeX,
  c2latex converts the C source file into a LaTeX source file.  It can
  be used to produce typeset listings of C programs and/or documentation
  associated with the program.

  C2latex produces LaTeX source by implementing a small number of rules.
  A C comment that starts at the beginning of a line is copied
  unmodified into the LaTeX source file.  Otherwise, non-blank lines are
  surrounded by a pair of formatting commands (\begin{flushleft} and
  \end{flushleft}), and the lines are separated by \\*. Each non-blank
  line is formatted using LaTeX's \verb command, except comments within
  the line are formatted in an \mbox.

Support:        Send bug reports to ramsdell@mitre.org.

description:    c2man is an automatic documentation tool that extracts comments
                from C source code to generate functional interface
                documentation in the same format as sections 2 & 3 of the Unix
                Programmer's Manual. It requires minimal effort from the
                programmer by looking for comments in the usual places near the
                objects they document, rather than imposing a rigid
                function-comment syntax or requiring that the programmer learn
                and use a typesetting language. Acceptable documentation can
                often be generated from existing code with no modifications.
conformance:    supports both K&amp;R and ISO/ANSI C coding styles
features:       + generates output in nroff -man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or HTML
format
                + handles comments as part of the language grammar
                + automagically documents enum parameter & return values
                + handles C (/* */) and C++ (//) style comments
                - doesn't handle C++ grammar (yet)
requires:       yacc/byacc/bison, lex/flex, and nroff/groff/texinfo/LaTeX.
ports:          Unix, OS/2, MSDOS, VMS.
portability:    very high for unix, via Configure
status:         actively developed; contributions by users are encouraged.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.5">9.5 Fold2Web</A></H2>

<P>
<PRE>
Developer:      Bernhard Lang &lt;lang@tu-harburg.d400.de&gt;
Version:        V0.8
Hardware:       MSDOS
Languages:      All (must allow comment lines)
Formatter:      LaTeX
Availability:   Anonymous ftp from: 
                  kirk.ti1.tu-harburg.de (134.28.41.50)

                    /pub/fold2web/fold2web.zip
Readme:         In distribution

Description:

  The idea behind the Fold2Web tool is the following: A programmer can
  write his program source with a folding editor and later map the
  folded source files automatically to WEB-files. The generated WEB-files
  can then be modified by inserting required documentations.
  
  The advantage by starting program developement with original sources is
  to get short design cycles during the compile/debug steps. By using a
  folding editor the global structuring information can be already
  captured in folds during this developement phase. Fold information is
  typically stored in comment lines and thus will not affect the
  efficiency of the compile/debug design cycle.
  
  Some folding editors and a folding mode for the emacs are available
  (e.g. see our FUE folding editor for MSDOS machines which is a modified
  micro emacs. Pick it at kirk in directory /pub/fold2web).
  
  After reaching a stable version of a program source its time to convert
  the source file to a WEB-file and do the program documentation.
  Fold2Web is written to convert folded source text of any programming
  language to nuweb files. The folded structure is kept by mapping folds
  to scraps. Fold markers which differ between languages due to different 
  ways of specifying comments can be configured for each language.
  
  Good results can also achived when given but poor documented program
  sources have to be modified. Such sources can be folded using a folding
  editor to extract the global structures. This offers a global view to
  the program structures and help to understand its functionality.
  Furthermore the program code is not affected, only comment lines are
  inserted. Once folded the program source can be automatically
  translated to a WEB document using the above tool.

<H2><A NAME="ss9.6">9.6 Funnelweb Mode</A></H2>

Developer:      Daniel Simmons &lt;simmdan@kenya.isu.edu&gt;
Version:        Unknown
Availability:   http://www.miscrit.be/~ddw

Description:

The other day I did a quick hack to nuweb.el as included with the nuweb
distribution so as to make a funnelweb-mode.el.  I've only used it
briefly, and I'm sure that it can be improved quite a bit.  I've been
thinking about adding support for folding on sections, a pull-down menu
to select macro definitions (like the recent functions posted to
gnu.emacs.sources for a C function definition pull-down menu) and some
kind of tags support for funnelweb.

<PRE>
Developer:      Bruce Stephens &lt;bruce@liverpool.ac.uk&gt;
Version:        Unknown.
Availability:   LitProg archives (in an email message).

Description:

This is a very simple mode I just hacked up.  There's a lot wrong with
it, but I thought others may be interested, even as it stands.  It
*requires* text properties, and assumes those used in GNU Emacs 19.22;
it'll quite likely work with Lucid Emacs, but I haven't tried it.

I use it with auctex8.1 and cc-mode 3.229, both of which are loaded
separately (I think my emacs is dumped with them, in fact).

The idea is to have one mode (which calls itself c-mode, but actually
has LaTeX-mode keybindings) generally (this means that the code is
hilighted nicely), and have the code chunks use a different keymap.

Description:

  Provides a major mode extending Auctex for editing nuweb files. Main
  features (in 2.0):
        - Edit scrap bodies in a separate buffer in a different mode
      (selected using emacs defaults for files, specific indication
      -*-mode-*-, or a buffer-local variable)
          - Extends Auctex commands so that nuweb is called before LaTeX,
          - Easy navigation on scrap definition and use points.
          - Now creates an imenu (C-M-mouse1) with user index entries, macro
      definition positions and file definition positions.

                    thrain.anu.edu.au:pub/web/EMACS.web-mode

Description:

This version works with versions 18 and 19 of Emacs to be best of my
knowledge.  I have cleaned up a number of documentation items ...
In the same directory is wm_refcard.tex which is an edited version of
the famous one to include some web-mode commands.

The files limbo* are related to its use and notice that half them
have an uppercase L in them for LaTeX.  The setup is based upon the
fact that we (I am not alone here) primarily use FWEB for C and Fortran
programming.

We are using version 1.40 of FWEB although John Krommes warns that it
is not mature and the manual is not yet updated.  The info files are!
We are using LaTeX almost exclusively.  That will likely change and we
will revert to version 1.30 if the final form of 1.40 cannot return
to the simple section numbers and avoid the HORRIBLE LATEX 0.1.7.2.4.6
type section numbers.
