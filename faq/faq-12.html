<P>Nelson Beebe has collected an extensive bibliography treating literate
programming.  His work is available for anonymous ftp from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/index.html#litprog">ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/index.html#litprog</A>.  Be sure
to look around this site; there are many things of interest to user of
TeX resources as well as literate programmers.</P>
<P>Although I have not verified this, LPA is an alternate source for these
files.  Note that they are updated frequently (Nelson says several times
each week), so be sure to get a fresh copy before extensive use.
Joachim Schrod indicates that these files may be updated daily and can
be retrieved via anonymous ftp at LPA/documentation.</P>
